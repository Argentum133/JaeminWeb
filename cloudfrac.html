						<h2>Cloud Fraction and Deforestation in the Amazon</h2>
					</header>                    

					<div class="box">
						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>
							Deforestation in the Amazon is currently one of the greatest environmental threats. 
							Land use, typically in agriculture and energy production have led to deforestation and 
							have presented severe loss in biodiversity as well as increases in CO2. Losses in Earth’s 
							biosphere due to deforestation have been clear and prevalent, but the effects to the 
							atmosphere may be overlooked. Changes in land can cause severe shifts in climate and weather 
							patterns. In its most extreme case, deforestation could lead to desertification. By analyzing 
							satellite images across the Amazon Basin, we can quantify how the atmosphere may be affected 
							by deforestation. 
							</p>

						<p>
							In this research project, we analyze changes in Cloud Fractions across the periods of 
							2004-2018 from the NASA Aura satellite’s Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). All the 
							code and associated files are contained in my GitHub repository and  can be found at: 
							<a href= "https://github.com/Argentum133/Cloud-Fractions-Amazon-Basin">https://github.com/Argentum133/Cloud-Fractions-Amazon-Basin</a>

						</p>	
                        <h3>Analyzing Cloud Fraction</h3>
                        <p>
							Cloud fraction is the percentage of pixels in an image covered with clouds. It is therefore 
							a good representation of cloud cover. Cloud fraction is a unitless measurement ranging from 
							0-1 with 1 representing pixels that are entirely covered by clouds and 0 having no clouds. 
						</p>
						<p>
							From the image above, we can see the data is stored as an HDF 2-d array. Over this 14-year 
							period there was about 5000 files which amounts to around 1 per day. For easy analysis, I 
							decided to use Python to loop through the images. Below is an animation that loops through and 
							plots all the cloud fraction data onto a map for 2015.
						</p>
						<p>
							We can see that looking through 5000 maps might become tedious, so in order to make long-term 
							trends, I aggregated the cloud fraction data into one value per image. Reading all the files in 
							Python, I created a separate .csv datafile that contained the average cloud fractions of each file. 
							The first .csv file is titled “CloudFracDataWhole.csv” and can be found my GitHub Repository that I 
							linked above <em>(*note: I later created another data-set that converted the date tags to Gregorian 
								days to make future data analysis simpler”)</em>. 
						</p>
						<h3>Results</h3>
						<p>
							Here is the complete plot of all the averaged cloud fraction values across the Amazon Basin.
						</p>
						<p>
							As you can see, there is a downward trend masked by seasonal trends. A good way to filter these 
							seasonal effects is to apply a running-mean with a 365-day window. If you are unfamiliar with the 
							running mean, it is a process that analyzes data points by creating a series of averages of different 
							subsets of the full data set.  Given a series of numbers and a fixed subset size, the first element of 
							the running mean is obtained by taking the average of an initial “window” or subset of the data. The 
							window is then “shifted forward” throughout the series. By applying a window of 365 days (or a year), the 
							model analyzes each individual day’s values and assimilates into a yearly pattern. In our case, the effects 
							of Earth’s seasons are removed, and the overall long-term trends are highlighted.
