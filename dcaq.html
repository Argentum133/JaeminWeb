						<h2>D.C. Air Quality Concerns in Urban Planning</h2>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        
                        <p> 
                            Air quality is a huge concern for communities, however assessing its 
                            effects purely using quantitative methods may not be the most honest 
                            representation. In the US, air quality standards are set through the EPA's 
                            National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), with criteria pollutants 
                            measured against a tedious averaging procedure. As pollutants interact with 
                            the atmosphere, concentrations can change. To account for this, the EPA sets 
                            limits based on the highest averaged window of time. For businesses, state/local 
                            governments, and parties most sensitive to health effects of pollutants, 
                            this method may be of concern. By averaging pollution during a portion of 
                            the day and only taking the maximum of those calculations, air quality may 
                            be under-rated for safe levels. To show these discrepancies, our team will 
                            compare different measurement techniques that better represent certain 
                            parties and forecast future pollution levels.

						<p>This project analyzes hurricanes in the 10-year period from 2005-2014 and 
                            their intersections with counties and roads. This type of GIS visualization 
                            can be helpful in urban planning as well as disaster relief efforts. It is 
                            one of the many examples of how GIS can be useful in the real world. 
                            All the code and associated files are contained in my GitHub repository and 
                            can be found at:
